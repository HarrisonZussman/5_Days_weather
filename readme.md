Weather-App

## Desciption

I wanted to test my skills on an app that uses an API. The basis behind this weather app is that it needed 2 API's. One for the current day and another API for the next 5 day forecast. 
I learned how to skip on a for loop, it was to late for me to put it on the script.js, for example (let i = 0; i < something.length; i+=8). It also taught me about local storage.
